                <p>Why Port Forwarding?</p>
                <p>
                    Suppose a scenario that we have three machines, host A, host B and host C. For some reasons,
                     host A and host C cannot communicate with each other. But host B can communicate with host A and host C.
                    One possible reason is that host A and host C are in two different networks, host B has two network interfaces that connect to 
                    the networks where host A and host C are, respectively. So intuitively, we want host B helps to forward traffic between host A and host C.
                </p>
                <p>Solution</p>
                <p>By using ssh -L we can achieve this. Suppose host A has IP 10.130.250.12, host B has IP 10.130.250.65 and 172.16.221.3, host C has IP 172.16.221.128. 
                    Because host A and host C are not in the same network, they cannot communicate. Now, we hope that host A can directly ssh into host C. So we can run
                </p>
                <p><i>ssh -L 2721:172.16.221.128:22 username@10.130.250.65</i></p>
                <p><i>[ssh -L localPort:targetIP:targetPort intermediary-username@intermediary-host]</i></p>
                <p> in host A. This command creates a socket to listen port 2721 on host A. Whenever it detects traffic that goes to port 2721, it will 
                    forward the traffic to 172.16.221.128:22 (host C) via 10.130.250.65 (host B). Therefore, if we run ssh username@localhost -p 2721, openssh will forward it to the 172.16.221.128:22 (host C).
